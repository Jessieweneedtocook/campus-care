Testing Documentation for Campus Care

1. Introduction

This testing documentation provides an overview of the unit tests written for Campus Care. These unit tests are designed to verify the functionality and behavior of various components of the software.

2. Test Environment Setup

The tests are written using the Python unittest framework. Additionally, the unittest.mock module is utilized for mocking external dependencies and controlling their behavior during testing.

3. Test Cases

This section contains individual test cases written for different modules and functionalities of the software. Each test case is aimed at validating specific behavior or scenarios.

* test_increment_current_question_index: Verifies the incrementing of the current question index within the application.
* test_question_index_resets: Ensures that the question index resets properly under certain conditions.
* test_screen_transitions: Validates the functionality of screen transitions within the application.
* test_daily_quiz_completion_check: Checks the behavior of the daily quiz completion function.
* test_handle_empty_user_preferences: Tests the handling of empty user preferences.
* test_no_data_returned_from_db_queries: Verifies the behavior when no data is returned from database queries.
* test_external_api_failure_during_signup: Validates the behavior when an external API fails during the signup process.
* test_handle_non_existent_user_ids: Tests the handling of non-existent user IDs.
* test_no_selected_activities_for_quiz: Checks the behavior when no activities are selected for the quiz.
* test_popup_display_functionality: Verifies the functionality of popup display within the application.
* TestSignupScreen: Contains test cases specifically for the SignupScreen class.
* TestDailyQuizScreen: Contains test cases specifically for the DailyQuizScreen class.

4. Test Procedures

To run the tests, execute the test file using a Python interpreter. The unittest.main() function at the end of the file runs all test cases defined within the file.

5. Conclusion
